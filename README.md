### CDM: Audio Narrative Assignment
*By Mia Schnelker*

For my narrative, I want to focus on life in the outdoors, specifically in a campsite. The audience will be brought the serene and free feeling of being in a place with no pressures or deadlines. The story will follow the bliss of waking up in nature, and the calmness of a slow morning in the woods. I plan to include minimal dialogue and focus more on the sounds of wilderness and the beauty of living among it.

### Project Updates
*Jan 28, 2025*

I started my project by writing a transcription of the narrative and collecting some sounds to use. I originally focused on finding audios that would transport the listener to an outdoor setting. I really liked the recordings of birds and rustling leaves I found, and I think the combination of the two does a great job at creating the environment. After finding those, I starting with the actual storyline and narrative, which starts with someone waking up in their sleeping bag and tent. Overall, I’m really happy with the audios I found, and will just need to record a few things myself and work with the volume and effects to truly create the story I’m aiming for. 

I ran into a few issues while importing the first few audios. For one, I realized my narrative is too long and will need to be altered to something simpler. However, I think there are a few things I’d be fine with cutting out and will honestly make the process easier. I also noticed the sound I chose for the leaves was far too short, and I’m going to have to play around with it so it can loop without any apparent or harsh cuts in the audio. For the most part, though, I wanted to work on just starting to build the storyline and putting the audios where they belong. I think I accomplished this and found the gaps I need to fill for the future. What I was left with can be found <a href = "https://github.com/mschnelk/audio-narrative-2025spring/blob/main/narrative%20drafts/camground_1_28_25.mp3"> here</a>, and the following is a screenshot of my audacity file.

My next goals are going to be editing the transcript to make it feasible for the given time, recording audios myself that I think will be useful, and finding and adding audios for the rest of the narrative. My plan is to add audios where they belong first, then worry about the volume, editing, and making it sound more realistic after I have a general idea of how the sounds overlap and interact with each other in the storyline.
