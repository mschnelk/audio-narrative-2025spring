### Beneath the Pines
*By Mia Schnelker*

For my narrative, I want to focus on life in the outdoors, specifically at a campsite. The audience will be brought the serene and free feeling of being in a place with no pressures or deadlines. The story will follow the bliss of waking up in nature, and the calmness of a slow morning in the woods. There is no dialogue, as the scene follows a solo camper enjoying their morning. 

I am creating this project using Audacity, importing audios from <a href= "https://freesound.org/"> freesound</a> as well as recording some myself. The full list of credits can be found <a href = "https://github.com/mschnelk/audio-narrative-2025spring/blob/main/CREDITS.md"> here</a>, and the most up-to-date Audacity file can be found <a href = "https://github.com/mschnelk/audio-narrative-2025spring/blob/main/beneath_the_pines.aup3">here</a>.

### Project Updates

*Feb 5, 2025*

This is not a progress update, but simply my current thoughts on the project. I got some useful feedback from my peers that I plan on implementing. There were a few mentions of minor changes, such as cleaning up gaps and adding in more fading, but the biggest suggestion was to add more emotion, another scene, or a reason for the camping. I thought this was a great idea, because I think cutting the narrative down from two people camping to one removed a large portion of the human or emotional element. Some ideas I thought of are: 
* Having my character wake up from a nightmare, breathing heavily, and as they complete their routine their breathing slows. This could emphasize the peace that being in nature and camping brings to people.
* Having the character pull out an instrument and start singing at the end of the narrative, which I think would help show that the character is at ease and enjoying their time outdoors.
* Some sort of wildlife interaction, spotting a bear or other cool animal. this would be an opportunity to add some dialogue and emotion to the character and build a connection between the audience and the character.

I plan to incoorporate at least one of these ideas into my audio narrative. I hope to add more dimension to the story and character with these changes, and am excited to have another challenge to incorporate. I also think this would be a great opportunity to try new effects and work with parts of Audacity that I've left untouched so far.

Although I made a lot of progress on this narrative, the biggest difference was that I changed the storyline. Orginally, I had planned to include two people camping together, and would have them doing different tasks simultaneously, utilizing the panning audio effect and volume to give the audience the impression of two people working nearby. However, my story proved to be too long when I tried to implement it in Audacity. Instead, I decided to focus on a solo camper getting their day started. As such, I had to remove and alter some of the effects I had added last time. I decided to have the character moving around the campsite doing different tasks so I could make use of the panning and volume. 

During this session of working I made a lot of progress, despite my change of course. This is the first time I've every worked with the Audacity interface, and there were definitley issues along the way. I realized that I kept making changed by hitting the wrong buttons or shortcuts and had to go back and search the my clips numerous times to find where I had messed up. It was a time consuming effort, but I am really happy with how my draft turned out. I think that the more time I spent on Audacity, the more I got comfortable with changing sounds and adding effects.

My first accomplishment was creating a long audio stream of leaves rustling. The audio I picked is only about 16s long, and I spend a lot of time trying to find a good cutoff in order to loop it. It took some trial and error, but I eventually found a way to seamlessly transition from the end to beginning of the clip. Although it's just a background noise, the leaves are a big contributor to the outdoor ambience, so I was very happy when I was able to turn a 15s clip into a 2:40 clip. I also liked the way I used fading, panning, and volume changes to create the sense that the character is moving around. My narrative involves the character boiling water and making tea as well as making a campfire, so they traverse back and forth between the areas a couple times. I used the effects to create the sense of distance between these two objects, and I'm happy with the way it turned out. I also decided to incorporate a small shift in volume of the background noises between when the character is in the tent versus outside, that I really enjoyed, even though I don't think it's very noticeable unless you really listen for it. However, it was small changes like that which really brought the project together. 

This audio narrative proved difficult to create. I had a lot of fun finding the sounds, but putting them all together and creating a seamless audio turned out to require much more effort and headache (who knew). It's really hard to build an environment without visual cues to help the audience understand where they are and what is happening. However, I am proud of my end result and excited to work on it further.

I started my project by writing a transcription of the narrative and collecting some sounds to use. I originally focused on finding audios that would transport the listener to an outdoor setting. I really liked the recordings of birds and rustling leaves I found, and I think the combination of the two does a great job at creating the environment. After finding those, I starting with the actual storyline and narrative, which starts with someone waking up in their sleeping bag and tent. Overall, I’m really happy with the audios I found, and will just need to record a few things myself and work with the volume and effects to truly create the story I’m aiming for. 

I ran into a few issues while importing the first few audios. For one, I realized my narrative is too long and will need to be altered to something simpler. However, I think there are a few things I’d be fine with cutting out and will honestly make the process easier. I also noticed the sound I chose for the leaves was far too short, and I’m going to have to play around with it so it can loop without any apparent or harsh cuts in the audio. For the most part, though, I wanted to work on just starting to build the storyline and putting the audios where they belong. I think I accomplished this and found the gaps I need to fill for the future. What I was left with can be found <a href = "https://github.com/mschnelk/audio-narrative-2025spring/blob/main/narrative%20drafts/beneath_the_pines_1_28_25.mp3"> here</a>, and the following is a screenshot of my audacity file.

My next goals are going to be editing the transcript to make it feasible for the given time, recording audios myself that I think will be useful, and finding and adding audios for the rest of the narrative. My plan is to add audios where they belong first, then worry about the volume, editing, and making it sound more realistic after I have a general idea of how the sounds overlap and interact with each other in the storyline.
